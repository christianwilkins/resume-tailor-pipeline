\begin{letter}{DoorDash Hiring Team\\DoorDash\\San Francisco, CA}

\opening{Dear DoorDash Hiring Team,}

I am writing to apply for the Software Engineer I position at DoorDash. As a Michigan State University computer science student graduating in December 2025, I am inspired by DoorDash's mission to empower local economies through a resilient three-sided marketplace.

During my internship with JPMorgan Chase, I co-led an AI-powered talent matching engine that used Python, scikit-learn, spaCy, and PostgreSQL to align internal candidates with open roles, earning first place at the JPMC Global Hackathon out of 1,000+ participants. I also re-architected AWS S3 data migration pipelines with \texttt{concurrent.futures} and \texttt{boto3} to cut processing time by 95\% and introduced PactFlow contract tests across microservices, experience that mirrors DoorDash's emphasis on scalable, well-tested systems.

At Configura, I delivered a customer-facing sales extension inside a 75M+ line proprietary platform by partnering closely with clients and senior engineers. Designing new 3D hit detection algorithms and navigating the massive codebase strengthened my ability to ship dependable features, maintain clean architecture, and analyze performance—critical skills for evolving DoorDash's logistics infrastructure.

Beyond internships, I built HIPAA-compliant ML pipelines that auto-grade standardized patient exams with 89\% validation accuracy, deepening my data engineering fundamentals. As board advisor for Imagine Software, I mentor 60 student developers on system design, APIs, and code reviews, reflecting the collaborative growth mindset DoorDash cultivates.

I would be excited to bring my background in Python, Go, Java, SQL, and distributed systems to your team, learn from DoorDash mentors, and contribute to products that have tangible impact on merchants, dashers, and consumers. Thank you for your consideration; I welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can help advance DoorDash’s next generation of logistics solutions.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
