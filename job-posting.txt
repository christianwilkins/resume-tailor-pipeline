The Kleiner Perkins (KP) Fellows Program recognizes the importance of providing next-generation leaders with engineering opportunities. The KP Fellows program introduces students interested in technology and entrepreneurship to contribute to and learn from growing startups that we believe in, while receiving support from a community of peers and industry leaders.

As a KP Fellow you will work directly with a Kleiner Perkins portfolio company. You’ll have an incredible summer experience which includes a curated founder speaker series, entrepreneurial workshops, and community building events. After the program, you will join an alumni community of 1,000+ up-and-coming technology leaders and successful founders, and receive continual support from KP for your entrepreneurial endeavors.

Applications are now open until 11:59pm PST on October 10. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis.
